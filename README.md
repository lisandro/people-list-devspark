The app should allow a user to manage a typical contact list, not the device’s contact list but one created solely for this app. The contacts must have their full name, address, phone number, email, and a description.

User Stories

1. As a user I want to see all my contacts in a list.
2. As a user I want to see one contact’s full data.
3. As a user I want to create and edit new contacts.
4. As a user I want to keep my contact list persistent between runs of the application.
5. As a user I want to attach a profile picture to a contact.
6. As a user I want to search contacts by name.
7. As a user I want to change the visualization of my contact list, changing between list and grid.
8. As a user I want to call a contact.
9. As a user I want to text a contact.
10. As a user I want to email a contact.
11. As a user I want to set a contact’s profile picture using the phone camera.
